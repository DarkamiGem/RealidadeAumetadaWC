These photos were taken by Mark DuBois in Kazan, Russia. They are provided for use by competitors for the team challenge on day C4.
They were taken using a Ricoh Theta S.

Note that some photos may be better than others. I recommend reviewing and selecting the one(s) you think are best.

If you use them for other purposes, please provide credit to the photographer and indicate where they were taken.
